### Usage

Append `?query=search+query` to the pages URL to search pages by file name or file content.

Add this snippet just before the `</header>` in `header.php` file of your active layout to add the default search form:

~~~ .html.php
<search>
  <?= self::form('search'); ?>
</search>
~~~

You can also define specific search query parameter key and route in this default search form component:

~~~ .html.php
<search>
  <?= self::form('search', [
      'key' => 'search.term', // Custom search query
      'route' => '/product/zoids' // Custom search context
  ]); ?>
</search>
~~~

This page conditional statement is available to quickly determine the type of page we are currently in:

`$site->has('query')`
: Return `true` if current page is a search results page.

### Recursive Search

There is a recursive page search feature available from the `/search` route:

~~~ .html.php
<search>
  <?= self::form('search', ['route' => '/search']); ?>
</search>
~~~

If there is a page file stored as `.\lot\page\search.archive` or `.\lot\page\search.page`, then that file will come
first. To avoid this route conflict, you can change the default search route (which is `'/search'`) to something else in
the state file.
